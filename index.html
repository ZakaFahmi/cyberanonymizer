      <p><font face="Arial">Is the world wide web an anonymous playground for visiting your
      favorite sites from the comfort and privacy of your home? Many people think their on-line
      sessions are anonymous and private.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, every time you visit a site, you leave a calling card
      that reveals private and personal information. Where you're coming from, what kind of
      computer you have, and other details of your on-line adventures are available to every
      site you enter. In fact, with a little effort, the exact computer which visited any site can be discovered. And, most sites keep logs of all your visits. <a href="http://www.cyberarmy.com/cgi/whoami.cgi">Click here</a> to see just a few things we know about you right now.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">This logging of your activities, in many cases, may constitute a
      violation of your privacy. The Cyber Anonymizer is provided to protect you from the
      prying eyes of the Internet. Your identity is kept completly private and untraceable. Enter the URL of where you want to visit and you will surf
      there anonymously:</font></p>
